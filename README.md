# Simple TicTacToe in C


 The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3x3 grid the game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diag-onal sequence of three marks wins. Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark, change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.

  - The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
  - One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells. 
  - The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’). 
  - If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
